### Project Objective

We built an online community for NEU students as project 3, however, after conducting the usability interview with several users,<br/>
we find 2 major problems: 1. the design is not good enough according to the design principles we learned in class; 2. a major usability<br/>
problem is that the newest post will be updated at the last page, instead of the first page, which makes it hard (or impossible when there<br/>
are lots of posts) to read the newest posts. <br/>
Considering this, we made 2 major improvements: 1. change the outlook of the website, add pictures, change the colors, and highlight NEU-related<br/>
factors. This adjustment is tremendous and you definitely have to check it out! It has a Google style, but 100 times more beautiful than Google<br/>
2. We also changed the order of posts being displayed, so that new posts will appear at the top page instead of the last page.<br/>
With these 2 improvements, our website is now more user-friendly and good-looking.

### Code Review By Yuan Wang
You guys have been doing a great job, it looks good to me overall, However I still have suggestions/advices that has been listed down below.
- It would be better to assign the CSS file to its responding modules, it would be easier for other programmer for future expansion.
- Could've used a color consistent color palette that is aligned with the app purpose.
- Could've used an adequate typography that matching the whole idea of your web applications
- Last, it would be organized to combine all the files of backend to one file
